# Roomies
**Roomies** is a room-mate matching site with a university accommodation review service. This helps university students find room-mates to stay with, and helps them choose what accommodation to stay at.

## Room-mate matching service
This service will compare profiles of two users and suggest high-compatibility users to each other. It must then allow them to chat in order to get to know each other, such that they can arrange to become room-mates.

## University accommodation reviews
Reviews provide customers looking for a product with some prior knowledge about the suitability of each option available, before they make any commitments. The reviews on Roomies will be done by users who have stayed at an accommodation before, and will consist of a rating and an optional written review. The accommodation listings will be places in close range to---including the halls of---the university. The universities will first consist solely of the University of Manchester, but more may come in the future.

There could be a secondary way of obtaining ratings for the accommodation; the staff personally collect the information and submit it as a 'poll'.
