# Introducing the room-mate matching service (primary feature)
Right, so the feature I'm introducing---and the primary feature of the website---is the room-mate-matching service.

# Why it's useful
A feature is only useful if it solves a problem.
So what's the problem? People looking for accommodation often want to live with a room-mate. Finding suitable room-mates can be hard.
We hope to solve this problem by helping them find suitable room-mates.
This is useful for anyone who needs a room-mate, though it will be aimed at people attending university the following year.

# What it does
This feature checks the compatibility of users, based on their profiles. (Slide side note: What else is it going to base it on?)
And then suggests them to each other. They will then add each other and (hopefully) they'll become friends and eventually room-mates.

# User profiles
Before you add someone, you'll probably want to know a little about them.
Now, the compatibility algorithm isn't going to be perfect. Maybe the other person is the same as you in every way... but has a pet spider.
User profiles are great for this.
Enough information would be shared on a user's profile, so that you can determine whether or not to add them to your contact list.

# Adding and deleting people
This list works in a similar fashion to social networking sites; you add people and talk to them.
The functional difference is that you won't be adding people you already know, but rather, people that the site suggests.
Also, you won't be adding them so that you can post cat videos to them. You'll be adding them to get to know them.
This puts much more emphasis on adding and removing contacts than the likes of social networking sites.

# Messaging service
Once you've added a few people, you'll want to talk to them. So we need a way of messaging each other.
For the time being, that will simply be a inbox. In the future, we would hope to have an instant chat. It's not important, but it would be useful.
With the feature that Liam will later introduce, we could expand instant chat to be very powerful.

# Another audience
As previously stated, the website will be aimed at people attending university the following year.
Whether or not they're looking for room-mates, these people will be looking for accommodation. And so, Elnur will introduce the next feature.
